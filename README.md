# Gastro Book
    An online recipe sharing service that allows users to create and share recipes with other avid lovers of cooking and all things food related!

## Description

- Our motivation for this project was to create a fun and easy way for users to create and share recipes with others!
- We built this project in order to gain more experience with various programming techniques, as well as learning how to work and coordinate well with other fellow programmers!
- The problem this application sought to solve was the issue of not being able to create online recipes in a simple way, as well as going through the trouble of finding the right wensite to share them on.
- We learned how to use Material UI, as well as how to be aware of how to spot our mistakes when using various libraries and frameworks.
